# My Personal Portfolio - PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, developed as part of the PLP Academy Feb 2025 Cohort Hackathon 1: Portfolio Challenge. It showcases my skills, background, projects, and contact information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

* **Programming Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **About Section:** A detailed introduction about myself, my passions, and my career aspirations.
* **Educational Background:** Information about my academic qualifications and a downloadable CV.
* **Interests:** My key interests within the tech field.
* **Projects:** Links to my projects with concise descriptions.
* **Contact:** Links to my contact information.
* **Download CV:** A prominent button to download my CV.

## üíª Website Structure

The website is structured as follows:

* `index.html`: The home page.
* `about.html`: The about me page.
* `projects.html`: The projects page.
* `contact.html`: The contact page.
* `style.css`: The main stylesheet for the website.
* `photo files/`: Directory containing images.
* `script.js`: Contains JavaScript functionality.

    ### JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

    * This file handles the "Download My CV" button functionality on the `about.html` page.
    * It uses JavaScript to:
        * Prevent the default link behavior.
        * Create a temporary anchor (`<a>`) element.
        * Set the `href` and `download` attributes to trigger a download.
        * Simulate a click on the link.
        * Remove the temporary link from the page.
        * This approach ensures a reliable download experience across browsers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* HTML: For structuring the web pages.
* CSS: For styling and layout.
* JavaScript: For interactive elements (e.g., download functionality).
